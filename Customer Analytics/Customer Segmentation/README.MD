# Customer Segmentation Project

## 1. Introduction

### Brief Overview of the Project
The goal of this project is to conduct customer segmentation analysis using the Online Retail Dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Customer segmentation involves dividing customers into groups based on similar characteristics or behaviors to tailor marketing strategies and improve business decision-making.

### Explanation of the Dataset: Online Retail Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
The Online Retail Dataset contains transactional data from an online retail company based in the UK. It includes customer purchases spanning a period of two years (from 01/12/2009 to 09/12/2011). The dataset includes information such as invoice numbers, product descriptions, quantities purchased, transaction timestamps, customer IDs, and country. This dataset provides valuable insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

### Objectives of the Project
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the dataset.
- Conduct customer segmentation analysis to divide customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, preferences, and other relevant factors.
- Implement clustering algorithms to identify meaningful customer segments.
- Interpret the results of the segmentation analysis and derive actionable insights.
- Provide recommendations for targeted marketing strategies, product recommendations, and other personalized approaches based on the identified customer segments.

### Importance of Customer Segmentation in Business Strategy
Customer segmentation is essential for businesses to better understand their customers and tailor their marketing strategies and offerings accordingly. By segmenting customers into groups with similar characteristics or behaviors, businesses can:
- Improve customer targeting and acquisition by focusing resources on high-potential segments.
- Enhance customer retention and loyalty through personalized marketing efforts and product recommendations.
- Optimize resource allocation and budgeting by prioritizing initiatives that are most likely to resonate with specific customer segments.
- Drive revenue growth and profitability by delivering relevant and timely offers to customers based on their unique needs and preferences.

## 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Load the dataset and inspect its structure
- Data cleaning:
  - Handle missing values
  - Remove duplicates
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA):
  - Statistical summary of numerical features
  - Distribution of categorical features
  - Visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, count plots) to understand the data distribution and identify patterns


## 3. Feature Engineering
- Create new features if necessary (e.g., total purchase amount, frequency of purchases)
- Transform data as needed (e.g., date/time conversion, encoding categorical variables)

## 4. RFM Analysis

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a method used to segment customers based on their recent transactional behavior. It helps identify customers who are more likely to respond to marketing campaigns, remain loyal, or churn. Here's how we conduct RFM analysis using the Online Retail Dataset:

### Recency
Recency refers to the time elapsed since the customer's last purchase. We calculate recency by subtracting the last purchase date from the current date. The lower the recency value, the more recently the customer has made a purchase.

### Frequency
Frequency represents the number of transactions made by the customer within a specific period, such as the entire dataset timeframe. We count the number of unique invoices associated with each customer to determine their frequency of purchase.

### Monetary Value
Monetary value indicates the total amount of money spent by the customer during the entire dataset timeframe. We calculate the total purchase amount for each customer by summing the monetary value of all their transactions.

### Segmenting Customers Based on RFM Scores
After calculating recency, frequency, and monetary value for each customer, we assign RFM scores to segment customers. We typically assign scores from 1 to 5 for each RFM parameter, with 5 indicating the highest value or most recent activity.

- Recency Score: 5 for the most recent customers, 1 for the least recent
- Frequency Score: 5 for the most frequent customers, 1 for the least frequent
- Monetary Score: 5 for the highest-spending customers, 1 for the lowest-spending

We then combine the RFM scores to create customer segments. For example, customers with an RFM score of 555 are considered the most valuable, while those with a score of 111 are the least valuable.

RFM segmentation allows us to target specific customer segments with tailored marketing strategies, such as offering discounts to dormant customers (low recency), loyalty rewards to frequent buyers (high frequency), or premium services to high-spending customers (high monetary value).

By analyzing customer behavior through RFM analysis, we can gain insights into customer segmentation and tailor our marketing efforts to maximize customer engagement and retention.

## 5. Clustering Analysis

### Selecting Clustering Algorithms
For this project, we will consider several clustering algorithms, including:
- K-means: A centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances from each point to its nearest centroid.
- Hierarchical clustering: A method that creates a hierarchy of clusters by recursively merging or splitting clusters based on similarity.
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): A density-based algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed, forming high-density regions.

### Feature Scaling
Before applying clustering algorithms, we'll standardize numerical features to ensure that all variables contribute equally to the clustering process. Standardization transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, preventing features with larger scales from dominating the clustering process.

### Applying Clustering Algorithms
We will apply the selected clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. This involves grouping customers with similar purchasing patterns together in clusters. The steps include:
1. Preprocess the data: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. Apply clustering algorithms: Run K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN on the preprocessed data.
3. Determine the optimal number of clusters:
   - Elbow method: Plot the within-cluster sum of squares against the number of clusters and identify the "elbow point" where the rate of decrease slows down.
   - Silhouette score: Calculate the silhouette score for different numbers of clusters and choose the number that maximizes the score, indicating well-separated clusters.
4. Visualize clusters:
   - Scatter plots: Visualize clusters using two or three principal components derived from dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
   - t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Apply t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, preserving local structure and revealing clusters.


## 6. Interpretation and Profiling of Customer Segments

### Analyze characteristics of each customer segment:

#### RFM Profiles:
- Recency: How recently did the customer make a purchase?
- Frequency: How often does the customer make purchases?
- Monetary: What is the total monetary value of the customer's purchases?

#### Purchase Behavior:
- Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order by each segment.
- Purchase Frequency: How frequently do customers in each segment make purchases?
- Customer Lifetime Value: The total value of purchases over the customer's lifetime.

#### Demographic Information (if available):
- If demographic data is available, analyze it to understand the composition of each customer segment based on factors such as age, gender, location, etc.

### Interpretation of Results:

#### What Distinguishes Each Segment from Others?
- Segment 1: "High-Value Customers"
  - High RFM scores indicating recent, frequent, and high-value purchases.
  - Likely to be repeat buyers and loyal customers.
  - May respond well to loyalty programs and exclusive offers.

- Segment 2: "Average Customers"
  - Moderate RFM scores indicating moderate recency, frequency, and monetary value.
  - Likely to make occasional purchases but not as frequently as high-value customers.
  - May respond well to targeted promotions or discounts to encourage repeat purchases.

- Segment 3: "Low-Value Customers"
  - Low RFM scores indicating infrequent, low-value purchases.
  - Likely to be one-time buyers or occasional shoppers.
  - May require incentives or personalized offers to increase engagement and repeat purchases.

#### Insights into Customer Behavior and Preferences:
- High-Value Customers:
  - Prefer premium products or services.
