## **Introduction**  

Diagnostic analytics focuses on identifying the root causes behind trends or patterns observed in descriptive analytics. By exploring relationships between variables, SQL enables data analysts to answer the critical question: **"Why did this happen?"**  

This repository provides practical examples, hands-on exercises, and real-world case studies to help you perform diagnostic analytics effectively using SQL.

## **Learning Path**  

### Beginner  
- Understanding the **What** vs. **Why** in Analytics.  
- Introduction to filtering and grouping:  
  - Using `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.  
- Simple joins to combine data:  
  - `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`.  

### Intermediate  
- Identifying anomalies and trends:  
  - Using `CASE` for conditional analysis.  
  - Time-based filtering and grouping with `DATEPART` and `DATE_TRUNC`.  
- Exploring relationships between variables:  
  - Correlation analysis using SQL techniques.  

### Advanced  
- Root cause analysis:  
  - Multi-table joins for deep insights.  
  - Creating diagnostic matrices with `PIVOT`.  
- Statistical diagnostics:  
  - Using window functions (`LAG`, `LEAD`, `RANK`) to identify changes over time.  

### Expert  
- Advanced anomaly detection:  
  - Comparing current vs. historical data with window functions.  
- Exploring cause-and-effect relationships:  
  - Subqueries for in-depth filtering.  
  - Recursive queries for hierarchical diagnostics.  
- Case studies:  
  - Customer churn diagnostics.  
  - Sales performance deep dives.
